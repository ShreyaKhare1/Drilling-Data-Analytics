  <h1>ROP Prediction</h1>
  <p>ROP depends on several interrelated and unrelated variables. 
  </p>
  <p>The results of ROP calculation with a mathematical equation are not reliable.
  </p>
  <p>However, ROP prediction can be done with ML models. The common models used for prediction of ROP are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linear regression
    </li>
    <li>Random forest
    </li>
    <li>Artificial neural networks
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>By simulation studies, least time to drill a well section by a particular type of bit can be computed prior to drilling the section, by maintaining a predefined values of drilling variables such as WOB, RPM, SPP , TQA and hydraulic variables such as Mud weight, PV, YP and gel strength.</p>
