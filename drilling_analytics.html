  <h1>Drilling Analytics</h1>
 <p>The common downhole drilling hazards which cause NPT are
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mechanical and differential stuck pipe</li>
  <li>String wash out 
  </li>
  <li>Mud motor failures</li>
  <li>Imbalance in downhole pressure 
  </li>
  <li>Kicks and blow out</li>
</ul>
<p>Such incidents result in loss of asset & equipment, injuries, loss of life & damage to the environment. It also leads to lawsuits and loss of reputation of the operator. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, it becomes imperative that oil and gas companies adopt advanced deep tech technologies to optimize their drilling operations.  Technologies such as data analytics, AI, ML, machine vision and video analytics can reduce NPT, ILT and optimize drilling operations. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prediction of drilling hazards prior to happening of event can be done with pattern recognition technologies. 
  </li>
  <li>Suitable algorithms when deployed on real time drilling data can provide clues to upcoming hazard, which is difficult to catch from looking at digital data or the time series drilling plots. 
  </li>
</ul>
